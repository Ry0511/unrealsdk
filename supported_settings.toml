# This file shows all settings which the sdk uses.

# DO NOT make a copy of this file as the basis of your config. Some values are intentionally bogus
# as there's no sane default to set them to (e.g. virtual function indexes), and will likely cause
# crashes if used.

# You are not expected to provide all settings, you should only set those you need. Some settings
# will change behaviour simply by being defined. For example, if `uproperty_size` is set, the sdk
# will not attempt to auto detect it, and will instead assume the provided value is accurate.

# Not all settings are used under all build configurations - for example UE3 doesn't support FText,
# so `ftext_get_display_string_vf_index` is of course unused.
